# TypeScript Backend Architecture Guide
## DDD + Clean Architecture — TypeScript Implementation

**Version**: v2.3
**Date**: 2026-05-11
**Scope**: Team backend service architecture standard  
**Prerequisites**:
- **Agent contract**: [`ddd-agent-contract.md`](ddd-agent-contract.md) — Code agents must read this first; defines trigger conditions, stop protocol, and prohibited actions. Do not skip.
- **Strategic modeling**: [`ddd-modeling.md`](ddd-modeling.md) — Complete this first to identify bounded contexts and aggregate boundaries from business requirements
- **Architecture spec**: [`ddd-core.md`](ddd-core.md) — Language-agnostic DDD + Clean Architecture rules. All architecture principles defer to `ddd-core.md`; in particular, the architecture review checklist lives at [ddd-core.md §10](ddd-core.md) and the consolidated principles summary lives at [ddd-core.md §11](ddd-core.md).
- This document is the TypeScript implementation guide that builds on both
**Runtime**: Node.js 22+  
**TypeScript**: 5.6+

> **Cross-reference convention**: major architecture sections align with the corresponding `ddd-core.md` sections where applicable. This guide adds TypeScript-specific workflow, placement, event/message, testing, and composition-root guidance.

> **Code blocks in this guide are illustrative**, not copy-paste templates. Imports may be omitted and identifiers may reference types defined elsewhere in the project. See [`ddd-agent-contract.md` §6](ddd-agent-contract.md).

## 0. TypeScript DDD Planning Workflow

Apply the planning gates defined in [ddd-modeling.md §7](ddd-modeling.md). For each gate level, the plan/spec must additionally state these **TypeScript-specific** items.

Every TypeScript backend plan must also include the `Architecture Gate` block from [ddd-modeling.md §0](ddd-modeling.md). For technical-facing packages, explicitly classify the capability before choosing between `domain`, `application`, `interfaces`, `infrastructure`, `shared`, or `packages/*`.

### Level 1 (Local Change)

Plan must additionally state:

- the TypeScript module being changed (e.g., `apps/api/src/modules/user/domain/`)
- why the module path matches the bounded context and layer responsibility
- whether tests live alongside the module (`*.spec.ts`) or in a separate `test/` tree (§9)

### Level 2 (New Use Case)

Plan must additionally state:

- file placement under the bounded context (`commands/`, `queries/`, `subscribers/`, `query-repository.ts` — see §6)
- new DTOs / zod schemas required (§3.2)
- import-boundary impact: generated contracts, Fastify/Express/Nest, ORM/query-builder, broker clients, and framework imports stay out of Domain
- mock/fake requirements for Application-layer tests (§9)
- composition-root wiring changes (§10)

### Level 3 (New Bounded Context or Aggregate)

Spec must additionally state:

- planned package layout under `apps/api/src/modules/<context>/` (§2.2)
- shared object placement decisions (§2.3) — what stays in the owning context, what goes in `shared/`, what goes in `packages/contracts/` or `packages/shared-kernel/`
- shared infrastructure provider ownership (DB pool, event bus, cache client — see §10)

### Cross-Context Change Without a New Context

Follow the multi-side planning rule in [ddd-modeling.md §7.4](ddd-modeling.md). The TypeScript-side plan must list:

- producing context's subscriber / event publisher path
- consuming context's subscriber and its idempotency strategy
- `packages/contracts/` updates if a new protocol contract or Integration Message payload is introduced

## 1. Architecture Principles

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

This guide combines **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Clean Architecture**, targeting:

1. **Domain-centric** — Business logic is independent of frameworks, UI, and databases
2. **Dependency inversion** — Inner layers define interfaces; outer layers implement them
3. **Vertical slicing** — Code organized by bounded context, not by technical layer
4. **Testability** — Business logic testable without external infrastructure

### 1.2 Layered Architecture

Four layers with the **Domain Layer as the core** (innermost):

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │        Interface Layer             │
                    │  HTTP / RPC / queue adapters       │
                    │  validation, routing, error maps   │
                    └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                    │ depends on
                    ┌───────────────▼─────────────────────┐
                    │       Application Layer             │
                    │  use-case orchestration,            │
                    │  transactions, DTOs, CQRS          │
                    └───────────────┬─────────────────────┘
                                    │ depends on
                    ┌───────────────▼─────────────────────┐
                    │         Domain Layer                │
                    │  aggregates, VOs, services,         │
                    │  write repository interfaces,       │
                    │  domain events                      │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ▲
                                    │ implements
        ┌───────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┐
        │        Infrastructure Layer                     │
        │  database, cache, MQ, third-party APIs,        │
        │  repository implementations                     │
        └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1.3 Dependency Rule

**Golden rule: dependencies point inward only. The Domain Layer must not depend on any other layer.**

- Interface Layer depends on Application and Domain layers
- Application Layer depends on Domain Layer
- Domain Layer must not import ORM, database, HTTP/RPC, cache, MQ, or third-party service client packages
- Infrastructure Layer depends on Domain Layer (implements Repository interfaces) and Application Layer (implements QueryRepository interfaces)

The Domain layer may use a small number of stable, general-purpose libraries when they do not introduce IO, framework lifecycle coupling, or transport/persistence concerns. Typical examples in TypeScript are `node:crypto`, `ulid`, and small in-memory helper abstractions.

> For full dependency rules and common violations, see [ddd-core.md §1.3](ddd-core.md). Concrete TypeScript code is shown in §3.1 / §3.2 / §3.4.

```

**`modules/` vs `shared/`** — `modules/` holds bounded contexts (the DDD four-layer structure); `shared/` holds technical infrastructure adapters used across contexts. Business code may depend on `shared/`; `shared/` must never import concrete business modules.

**One directory under `modules/` = one bounded context.** The directory name (`<context>`) is the bounded context's name, and its `domain/`, `application/`, `interfaces/`, `infrastructure/` sub-tree is the full DDD four-layer slice for that context. Do not split a single bounded context across sibling `modules/` directories, and do not collapse two bounded contexts into one.

### 2.2 Bounded Context Internal Structure

> Corresponds to [ddd-core.md §2.2](ddd-core.md).

```

├── domain/
│   ├── user.aggregate.ts
│   ├── value-objects.ts

├── application/
│   ├── commands/

│   │   └── find-user.query.ts
│   ├── handlers/
│   │   ├── change-password.handler.ts
│   │   ├── find-user.handler.ts
│   │   └── user-created.handler.ts
│   ├── dto.ts
│   ├── query-repository.ts
│   └── unit-of-work.ts
│
├── interfaces/
│   ├── http/
│   │   ├── user.routes.ts
│   │   └── schemas.ts
│   └── rpc/
│       └── user.controller.ts
│
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── persistence/
│   │   ├── user.repository.ts

│   │   ├── schema.ts
│   │   └── mapper.ts
│   └── messaging/
│       └── publisher.ts
│
└── module.ts
```

Start with flat files when the module is small. When handlers grow numerous, promote to sub-directories (`commands/`, `queries/`, `handlers/`, one file per handler). `module.ts` remains the single entry point that wires the bounded context.

### 2.3 Shared Object Placement

When a TypeScript type is needed by multiple modules, first decide what it represents:

1. **Domain concept owned by one bounded context**: keep it in the owning bounded context. Other contexts must not import it directly; exchange through Integration Messages, cross-context query facades, ACL, or protocol contracts (see §5).
2. **Cross-context / cross-service data contract**: define it in `packages/contracts/` from OpenAPI, Protobuf, JSON Schema, GraphQL SDL, or another contract-first source. Keep business derivation rules in the owning context.
3. **Shared technical capability**: place it in `apps/api/src/shared/<capability>/` when it adapts databases, message brokers, HTTP clients, telemetry, clocks, IDs, transactions, or other implementation mechanisms.
4. **Shared Kernel**: use `packages/shared-kernel/` only for a tiny, stable set of types that two contexts deliberately co-own. Avoid by default.
5. **General-purpose library intended for external reuse**: only then place hand-written code in a package outside `apps/api`.

Do not use `shared/` or `packages/shared-kernel/` as a dumping ground for internal business DTOs, read models, constants, or domain concepts. If a type carries business meaning, name its owner before moving it.

Generated contract types are DTOs / protocol contracts, not Domain entities or Value Objects. Domain methods, repository interfaces, and Domain Events use Domain-owned types; generated/protocol DTOs are mapped at Application, Interface, or Infrastructure boundaries.

### 2.4 TypeScript Boundary Checklist

Use this checklist before accepting a package layout or import graph:

- A path ending in `/domain` contains only domain concepts: aggregates, entities, value objects, domain services, write repository interfaces, domain events, and domain errors.
- Domain packages do not import Fastify, Express, NestJS, decorators, ORM/query-builder clients, generated contract packages, broker/cache clients, `shared/` adapters, `infrastructure/`, or another bounded context's Domain package.
- Application packages may import Domain and generated contract packages when they implement service stubs or map boundary DTOs, but they must not import concrete storage, queue, cache, or network clients.
- Infrastructure packages may import Domain/Application interfaces they implement, generated contract packages, and external clients.
- `apps/api/src/shared/<capability>` is only for shared technical adapters. It must not import `modules/*` or own business/domain rules.
- A generated type in a method signature is boundary evidence, not layer-ownership evidence. If the method represents a Domain capability, keep the interface in `domain/` with Domain types and map at the boundary.
- Package names and directory names must agree with the bounded context and layer they represent. A `dispatcher`, `registry`, `router`, `scheduler`, or `connector` module must still declare whether it is Domain-facing policy, Application orchestration, or Infrastructure adapter.

### 2.5 Technical Coordination Placement

Technical coordination code often exposes domain rules indirectly. Place it by rule ownership, not by mechanism:

| Example | Place the rule | Place the mechanism |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Connection/session registration with naming, ownership, admission, or lifecycle rules | `modules/<context>/domain` as a policy, service, value object, or aggregate behavior | Storage/lease/CAS implementation in `infrastructure/` or `shared/` |
| Dispatch routing with semantic destinations, priorities, or retry eligibility | Domain policy when destinations, priorities, or retry rules are stable language and testable without a queue; Application orchestration when it merely selects among Domain-defined ports | Queue/client/server adapter in Infrastructure |
| Scheduler with business-visible states or deadlines | Domain state/policy plus Application orchestration | Timer, worker, BullMQ/Temporal/Cron adapter, or lock backend in Infrastructure |
| Observability or audit derivation with business meaning | Domain event or Domain-facing projection rule | Telemetry/export backend in Infrastructure |

If the rule can be unit-tested without SQL, Redis, a queue, framework request objects, or generated contract types, keep that rule inward and adapt the mechanism outward.

## 3. Layer Responsibilities

### 3.1 Domain Layer

**Role**: Core business logic, independent from frameworks, transport, and persistence.

> For the full specification, see [ddd-core.md §3.1](ddd-core.md).

**Contents**:
- **Aggregate Root**: Guardian of business invariants
- **Entity**: Object with stable identity
- **Value Object**: Immutable object defined by attributes
- **Domain Service**: Cross-aggregate business logic
- **Repository Interface**: Write-side persistence abstraction
- **Domain Event**: Records significant domain occurrences

**Constraints**:
- No concrete implementation dependencies (no import of Fastify, Express, NestJS, decorators, ORM/query-builder clients, database drivers, HTTP clients, message queue clients, cache clients, generated contract packages, `shared/` adapters, `infrastructure/`, or another bounded context's Domain package)
- Must not depend on other bounded contexts' domain layers
- All state changes go through domain methods
- **No anemic aggregates.** An Aggregate Root that is a `type` / interface with public fields and no behavior, while the rules live in `application/handlers/`, is prohibited. Every state transition is a method on the Aggregate Root class (or Value Object). Use `private` fields + `private constructor` + static factory (`User.create(...)`); expose read-only access via getters; mutation only via named domain methods (`changePassword`, `activate`, …)
- **Version is a read-only concurrency token** — Infrastructure increments it
- **IDs are generated in Domain** via UUID/ULID factory methods — database auto-increment IDs are prohibited

**Factory Design**:
- Simple cases: use the Aggregate Root's own factory method (`User.create(...)`)
- Complex cases (assembling multiple Value Objects, cross-entity validation): extract an independent Domain Factory inside the domain package

**Domain Event Collection Contract**:
- Aggregate Root keeps an internal event list
- Domain methods append events; they never dispatch directly
- Application is the sole drainer. After successful persistence, Application calls `collectEvents()` exactly once and dispatches the returned events. Repository must not drain.
- `collectEvents()` drains the list; a second call returns an empty array. After `repo.save()` succeeds, the in-memory aggregate is stale; reload via `repo.get()` before further mutations.
- Domain Events are bounded-context-internal facts. Cross-context state propagation uses Integration Messages through an explicit port/adapter (see §5.2), not direct subscription to another context's Domain Events.

**Validation Contract** — implements [ddd-core.md §3.1 "Validation Contract"](ddd-core.md). TypeScript-specific notes:

- `validate(): void` (throwing a `DomainError` subclass) is the canonical method signature
- Inside `validate()`, you may use `zod`, `valibot`, or hand-written checks — these are an implementation detail. The Aggregate Root / Entity itself must not extend a zod schema or be a `class-validator`-decorated DTO; external layers must never call `Schema.parse(domainObj)` to validate a Domain object
- Use explicit code for cross-field rules and state-transition invariants that cannot be expressed cleanly with declarative schemas

**Domain Rules in Technical Capabilities** — see [ddd-core.md §3.1 "Domain Rules in Technical Capabilities"](ddd-core.md). The rule applies to TypeScript projects exactly as written.

**TypeScript-specific guidance**:
- Prefer `readonly` and private fields to preserve invariants
- Prefer factory methods over public constructors for aggregates
- Avoid decorators and framework metadata in Domain
- Keep `Date`, `bigint`, and `string` semantics explicit; do not hide business meaning inside loose primitives when a Value Object is warranted

```ts
// domain/events.ts
export interface DomainEvent {
  readonly type: string;
  readonly occurredAt: Date;
}

export class UserCreatedEvent implements DomainEvent {
  readonly type = "user.created";

  constructor(
    public readonly userId: string,
    public readonly name: string,
    public readonly email: string,
    public readonly occurredAt: Date,
  ) {}
}

export class PasswordChangedEvent implements DomainEvent {
  readonly type = "user.password_changed";

  constructor(
    public readonly userId: string,
    public readonly occurredAt: Date,
  ) {}
}
```

```ts
// domain/value-objects.ts
import { createHash, randomBytes, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

import { InvalidEmailError, WeakPasswordError } from "./errors";

export class Email {
  private constructor(public readonly value: string) {}

  static create(value: string): Email {
    const normalized = value.trim().toLowerCase();
    if (!/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(normalized)) {
      throw new InvalidEmailError(normalized);
    }
    return new Email(normalized);
  }
}

export class HashedPassword {
  private constructor(
    public readonly hash: string,
    public readonly salt: string,
  ) {}

  static reconstitute(hash: string, salt: string): HashedPassword {
    return new HashedPassword(hash, salt);
  }

  static fromPlain(raw: string): HashedPassword {
    if (raw.length < 8) {
      throw new WeakPasswordError();
    }
    const salt = randomBytes(16).toString("hex");
    const hash = createHash("sha256").update(`${salt}:${raw}`).digest("hex");
    return new HashedPassword(hash, salt);
  }

  verify(raw: string): boolean {
    const candidate = createHash("sha256")
      .update(`${this.salt}:${raw}`)
      .digest();
    const current = Buffer.from(this.hash, "hex");
    return candidate.length === current.length && timingSafeEqual(candidate, current);
  }
}

export enum UserStatus {
  Inactive = "inactive",
  Active = "active",
  Suspended = "suspended",
}
```

```ts
// domain/user.aggregate.ts
import { ulid } from "ulid";

import {
  PasswordChangedEvent,
  type DomainEvent,
  UserCreatedEvent,
} from "./events";
import { UserNotActiveError } from "./errors";
import { Email, HashedPassword, UserStatus } from "./value-objects";

  private constructor(private props: UserProps) {}

  static create(input: {

    rawPassword: string;
  }): User {
    const now = new Date();
    const user = new User({

    });

    user.record(

    );
    return user;
  }

    return this.props.hashedPassword;
  }

    return this.props.createdAt;
  }

  get updatedAt(): Date {
    return this.props.updatedAt;
  }

  changePassword(oldRaw: string, newRaw: string): void {
    if (this.props.status !== UserStatus.Active) {
      throw new UserNotActiveError();
    }
    if (!this.props.hashedPassword.verify(oldRaw)) {
      throw new Error("old password incorrect");
    }

    this.props = {
      ...this.props,
      hashedPassword: HashedPassword.fromPlain(newRaw),
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    };
    this.record(new PasswordChangedEvent(this.id, this.props.updatedAt));
  }

  collectEvents(): DomainEvent[] {
    const drained = [...this.events];
    this.events.length = 0;
    return drained;
  }

  private record(event: DomainEvent): void {
    this.events.push(event);
  }
}
```

```ts
// domain/repository.ts
import type { User } from "./user.aggregate";

export interface UserRepository {
  get(id: string): Promise<User | null>;
  save(user: User): Promise<void>;
}
```

### 3.2 Application Layer

**Role**: Orchestrate use cases; define transactions; coordinate Domain objects.

> Corresponds to [ddd-core.md §3.2](ddd-core.md). The TypeScript guide adds transaction and composition details specific to Node.js services.

**Contents**:
- Command and Query definitions
- Command and Query handlers
- DTOs
- QueryRepository interfaces
- Unit of Work / transaction boundary abstractions
- Event handlers for consuming domain events

**Constraints**:
- No business rules
- Depends on Domain
- Owns transaction boundaries
- **Default transaction boundary: one transaction modifies one aggregate only.** To modify multiple aggregates, prefer Domain Events / Integration Messages, a Saga / Process Manager, or compensating actions. A same-transaction multi-aggregate write is a design exception and must satisfy the gate in [ddd-core.md §3.2](ddd-core.md); do not implement one merely because the database transaction API makes it easy.
- Application is the sole drainer of Domain Events: after successful `repo.save()` it calls `collectEvents()` exactly once. Repository never drains.
- Dispatch domain events only after successful persistence. Publish/admission failure after persistence does not imply persistence rollback; choose the explicit error policy from [ddd-core.md §5.3](ddd-core.md).
- QueryRepository interfaces live here, return DTOs, and bypass Domain aggregates on the read side
- After `repo.save()`, the in-memory aggregate is stale — reload via `repo.get()` before any further operation on the same aggregate
- **File organization**: start with flat files for small contexts; when handlers grow numerous, promote to sub-directories (`commands/`, `queries/`, `handlers/`, one file per handler). `module.ts` remains the single entry point that wires the bounded context.

**Event Handler Contract**:
- Lives in the **consuming** bounded context's Application layer, not the producing context
- Each handler owns its own transaction; failures do not roll back the producing side
- Error handling: log and continue, retry, or route to adapter-specific failure handling; never propagate handler execution errors back to the Domain Event producer
- Write handlers so repeated execution is harmless when practical: prefer set/update operations, deterministic business keys, and guards on externally visible side effects

**Query Handler: When the Class Is Optional**:

For trivial reads, skip a dedicated `FindXxxHandler` class and let the Interface/Application entry point call `QueryRepository` directly. Keep an explicit Query Handler when the read path composes multiple calls, decodes cursors, filters/masks data, authorizes read-specific behavior, or applies a named cache/read policy.

```ts
// application/commands/change-password.command.ts
export type ChangePasswordCommand = {
  userId: string;
  oldPassword: string;
  newPassword: string;
};
```

```ts
// application/unit-of-work.ts
export interface UnitOfWork {
  runInTransaction<T>(work: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
}
```

```ts
// application/query-repository.ts
export type UserDetailDto = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  status: string;
  createdAt: string;
};

export interface UserQueryRepository {
  findDetail(id: string): Promise<UserDetailDto | null>;
}
```

```ts
// application/handlers/change-password.handler.ts
import type { EventBus } from "../../../shared/event-bus/event-bus";
import { UserNotFoundError } from "../../domain/errors";
import type { UserRepository } from "../../domain/repository";
import type { ChangePasswordCommand } from "../commands/change-password.command";
import type { UnitOfWork } from "../unit-of-work";

export class ChangePasswordHandler {
  constructor(
    private readonly repo: UserRepository,
    private readonly uow: UnitOfWork,
    private readonly eventBus: EventBus,
  ) {}

  async handle(command: ChangePasswordCommand): Promise<void> {
    const events = await this.uow.runInTransaction(async () => {
      const user = await this.repo.get(command.userId);
      if (!user) {
        throw new UserNotFoundError(command.userId);
      }

      user.changePassword(command.oldPassword, command.newPassword);
      await this.repo.save(user);
      return user.collectEvents();
    });

    await this.eventBus.publishAll(events);
  }
}
```

### 3.3 Interface Layer

**Role**: Protocol adaptation only.

> Corresponds to [ddd-core.md §3.3](ddd-core.md). In TypeScript, this layer usually contains Fastify/Express/Nest controllers, RPC handlers, validation schemas, and request/response mapping.

**Contents**:
- HTTP routes / controllers
- RPC handlers
- Request validation
- Authentication extraction
- Error mapping
- Request/response DTO mapping

**Constraints**:
- No business rules
- Depends on Application and Domain
- Owns protocol details such as headers, status codes, cookies, pagination envelopes

**TypeScript-specific guidance**:
- Put Zod/Valibot schemas here, not in Domain
- Do not leak Fastify/Express/Nest request objects into Application
- Map domain/application errors into transport errors here

```ts
// interfaces/http/schemas.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const changePasswordSchema = z.object({
  oldPassword: z.string().min(1),
  newPassword: z.string().min(8),
});
```

```ts
// interfaces/http/user.routes.ts
import type { FastifyPluginAsync } from "fastify";

import { ChangePasswordHandler } from "../../application/handlers/change-password.handler";
import { changePasswordSchema } from "./schemas";

export const userRoutes = (
  changePassword: ChangePasswordHandler,
): FastifyPluginAsync => {
  return async (app) => {
    app.put<{ Params: { id: string } }>("/users/:id/password", async (request, reply) => {
      const body = changePasswordSchema.parse(request.body);
      await changePassword.handle({
        userId: request.params.id,
        oldPassword: body.oldPassword,
        newPassword: body.newPassword,
      });
      return reply.status(204).send();
    });
  };
};
```

### 3.4 Infrastructure Layer

**Role**: Implement Domain and Application contracts against real external systems.

> Corresponds to [ddd-core.md §3.4](ddd-core.md). TypeScript-specific examples below use an explicit data-mapper style rather than active record.

**Contents**:
- Repository implementations
- QueryRepository implementations
- ORM / SQL mapping
- Cache clients
- MQ publishers / subscribers
- Third-party API clients

**Constraints**:
- No business rules
- Handles technical concerns: SQL, retries, pooling, serialization, timeouts
- Owns optimistic locking implementation; Domain holds `version` as a read-only token, Infrastructure increments it via SQL
- Must not leak ORM entities into Domain
- `save()` is the single method covering create, update, and state-driven soft delete; never split into `insert()` / `update()` / `delete()` based on SQL operation. `version === 0` → INSERT; `version > 0` → version-guarded UPDATE. `Save()` determines the operation internally based on the aggregate's state
- Adding a technical client (`ioredis`, `kysely`, an HTTP/MQ SDK) does not justify a new TS interface in `domain/` or `application/`. If Redis only accelerates a SQL-backed repository, compose it inside `infrastructure/persistence/`; do not introduce a separate `Cacher` interface. Add a new interface only for a named use-case capability (distributed lock, lease ownership, explicit cache invalidation, rate limiting, event publication)
- Infrastructure implements technical mechanisms for Domain rules, but it must not be the only place where those rules are expressed
- Shared clients/pools are initialized in `shared/` or the composition root; bounded-context Infrastructure receives initialized clients and does not read global config or open shared connections unless it owns that adapter

**Persistence Guidance**:
- Prefer explicit mapping over active-record style domain models
- Keep persistence schema types separate from Domain aggregates
- Optimistic locking should be implemented in the repository with `WHERE version = ?`

```ts
// infrastructure/persistence/schema.ts
export type UserRow = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password_hash: string;
  password_salt: string;
  status: string;
  version: number;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
};
```

```ts
// infrastructure/persistence/mapper.ts
import { HashedPassword, Email, UserStatus } from "../../domain/value-objects";
import { User } from "../../domain/user.aggregate";
import type { UserRow } from "./schema";

export function toDomain(row: UserRow): User {
  return User.reconstitute({
    id: row.id,
    name: row.name,
    email: Email.create(row.email),
    hashedPassword: HashedPassword.reconstitute(row.password_hash, row.password_salt),
    status: row.status as UserStatus,
    version: row.version,
    createdAt: row.created_at,
    updatedAt: row.updated_at,
  });
}
```

```ts
// infrastructure/persistence/user.repository.ts
import type { Kysely } from "kysely";

import { ConcurrentModificationError } from "../../domain/errors";
import type { UserRepository } from "../../domain/repository";
import type { User } from "../../domain/user.aggregate";
import { toDomain } from "./mapper";
import type { UserRow } from "./schema";

type Database = {
  users: UserRow;
};

export class KyselyUserRepository implements UserRepository {
  constructor(private readonly db: Kysely<Database>) {}

  async get(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
    const row = await this.db
      .selectFrom("users")
      .selectAll()
      .where("id", "=", id)
      .executeTakeFirst();

    return row ? toDomain(row) : null;
  }

  async save(user: User): Promise<void> {
    if (user.version === 0) {
      // New aggregate — INSERT, version starts at 1
      await this.db
        .insertInto("users")
        .values({
          id: user.id,
          name: user.name,
          email: user.email.value,
          password_hash: user.hashedPassword.hash,
          password_salt: user.hashedPassword.salt,
          status: user.status,
          version: 1,
          created_at: user.createdAt,
          updated_at: user.updatedAt,
        })
        .execute();
      return;
    }

    // Existing aggregate — version-guarded UPDATE; SQL increments version
    const result = await this.db
      .updateTable("users")
      .set({
        name: user.name,
        email: user.email.value,
        password_hash: user.hashedPassword.hash,
        password_salt: user.hashedPassword.salt,
        status: user.status,
        version: user.version + 1,
        updated_at: new Date(),
      })
      .where("id", "=", user.id)
      .where("version", "=", user.version)
      .executeTakeFirst();

    if (Number(result.numUpdatedRows ?? 0) === 0) {
      throw new ConcurrentModificationError(user.id);
    }
    // After save(), the in-memory user is stale — caller must reload via get() before further operations
  }
}
```

## 4. DDD Tactical Design Reference

| DDD Concept | Layer | TypeScript Implementation |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| **Aggregate** | Domain | `class` with private state + domain methods |
| **Entity** | Domain | `class` with stable ID |
| **Value Object** | Domain | immutable `class` / `type` with validated creation |
| **Domain Service** | Domain | stateless function / class |
| **Repository** | Domain + Infra | interface + implementation |
| **Query Repository** | Application + Infra | interface + implementation |
| **Domain Event** | Domain | immutable object with `type` + payload |
| **Application Service** (Command/Query Handler) | Application | use-case orchestration; concrete form is `<Action>Handler` class for commands, `Find<Target>Handler` for queries |
| **Event Handler** | Application | subscribed handler class/function |
| **DTO** | Application / Interface | explicit transfer `type` |
| **Factory** | Domain | static `create()` / dedicated factory |
| **CQRS** | Application | command/query separation |

---

## 5. Cross-Context Communication

> For the full specification (four legitimate mechanisms and Rich Event payload rules), see [ddd-core.md §5](ddd-core.md). This section captures the TypeScript decision points.

### 5.1 Direct Domain Coupling Is Prohibited

Bounded contexts must not import another context's Domain model or call its Application Service / Domain Service / Repository directly. Cross-module imports between `modules/<a>/domain/` and `modules/<b>/domain/` are a hard error.

### 5.2 Integration Messages (default for cross-context state propagation)

Integration Messages are cross-context semantic contracts. The default lifecycle follows [ddd-core.md §5.3](ddd-core.md): a Domain method records Domain Events inside the producing bounded context; the Application command handler saves the aggregate and drains those Domain Events; a same-context boundary translator / publisher selects publishable facts and maps them to Integration Message payloads; the publish port submits the message to the selected adapter. Adapter success means the adapter accepted the message according to its own semantics, not that any consumer has handled it.

Keep four layers separate:

- **Concept**: the cross-context fact another bounded context may depend on.
- **Contract**: `packages/contracts/` payload type, message kind/name, versioning, and compatibility rules.
- **Port**: implementation-independent publish / subscribe interfaces exposed to Application code.
- **Adapter**: Kafka, SQS, RabbitMQ, BullMQ, NATS, retry, DLQ, ordering, and provider-specific delivery behavior.

Subscribing directly to another context's Domain Event is prohibited. Domain Events stay inside one bounded context; Integration Messages carry the stable published-language payload across context boundaries.

Publication failures follow [ddd-core.md §5.3](ddd-core.md)'s policy table: ordinary notifications may log and keep the original command successful, command-visible publication should return the publish-port error explicitly, and pre-publish loss intolerance requires an explicit reliability design rather than a technology-shaped port.

### 5.3 Choosing Other Mechanisms

Use [ddd-core.md §5.2](ddd-core.md)'s four-mechanism table to pick the right tool:

- **Cross-context queries** — read-only DTOs through a port the owning context **explicitly exports** (e.g., `UserReader` / `UserSummaryPort`, a small read-side facade — *not* the context's internal `UserQueryRepository`, which is a CQRS read-side concern within the User context itself). Appropriate when the consumer needs a current snapshot and event-driven projection is not viable
- **Anti-Corruption Layer** — when integrating with external/legacy systems; lives in `infrastructure/` and is transparent to Domain
- **Protocol contracts** — for cross-service / cross-package data contracts; generated code lives in `packages/contracts/`, never imported by Domain

Do not default every cross-context interaction to asynchronous messaging — pick the simplest consistency model that satisfies the business requirement, but never bypass the boundary by reaching into another context's Domain layer.

Generated code in `packages/contracts/` is DTOs / contracts, not Domain entities. Do not place a port in `application/` just because its request/response are generated proto/OpenAPI types — decide port ownership from the semantic capability ([ddd-modeling.md §0.2](ddd-modeling.md)). When the capability is Domain-facing, keep the TS interface in `domain/` with Domain-typed signatures and map `Proto ↔ Domain` in `application/` (handler or assembler) or in an Infrastructure inbound adapter.

---

## 6. Naming Conventions

| Type | Naming Pattern | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Aggregate | `<Entity>` | `User` |
| Domain Event | `<Entity><Action>Event` | `UserCreatedEvent` |
| Command | `<Action><Entity>Command` | `ChangePasswordCommand` |
| Command Handler | `<Action><Entity>Handler` | `ChangePasswordHandler` |
| Query | `<Action><Entity>Query` | `FindUserQuery` |
| Query Handler | `<Action><Entity>Handler` | `FindUserHandler` |
| Repository Interface | `<Entity>Repository` | `UserRepository` |
| Query Repository | `<Entity>QueryRepository` | `UserQueryRepository` |
| Persistence Row | `<Entity>Row` | `UserRow` |
| Mapper | `toDomain` / `toRow` | `toDomain(userRow)` |

File naming:
- Prefer kebab-case file names
- Keep one primary concept per file
- Name files by role, not framework suffix noise

---

## 7. Recommended Technology Stack

These are **recommended team defaults**, not hard requirements:

| Purpose | Recommended Library |
|---------|---------------------|
| Runtime | Node.js 22+ |
| Language | TypeScript 5.6+ |
| HTTP Server | `fastify` |
| Validation | `zod` or `valibot` |
| SQL Query Builder | `kysely` |
| ORM alternative | `drizzle-orm` |
| DI / Composition | manual composition root or `awilix` |
| Logging | `pino` |
| Test Runner | `vitest` |
| API Contracts | OpenAPI / Connect / gRPC as needed |
| ID Generation | `ulid` or `uuid` |

**Selection Criteria**:
- Prefer libraries that keep Domain free from decorators and framework metadata
- Prefer explicit composition over magic auto-discovery
- Prefer schema-first or contract-first interfaces when multiple clients consume the API

---

## 8. Error Handling

### 8.1 Per-Layer Strategy

| Layer | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Domain | throw domain-specific errors |
| Application | translate missing entities / authorization / orchestration failures into use-case errors |
| Interface | map errors into HTTP/RPC status and response envelopes |
| Infrastructure | wrap low-level failures with operational context; do not leak driver-specific errors upward unchanged |

### 8.2 Domain Error Example

```ts
// domain/errors.ts
export class DomainError extends Error {}

export class UserNotFoundError extends DomainError {
  constructor(userId: string) {
    super(`user not found: ${userId}`);
  }
}

export class InvalidEmailError extends DomainError {
  constructor(email: string) {
    super(`invalid email: ${email}`);
  }
}

export class WeakPasswordError extends DomainError {
  constructor() {
    super("password too weak");
  }
}

export class UserNotActiveError extends DomainError {
  constructor() {
    super("user is not active");
  }
}

export class ConcurrentModificationError extends DomainError {
  constructor(entityId: string) {
    super(`concurrent modification detected: ${entityId}`);
  }
}
```

### 8.3 HTTP Error Mapping Example

```ts
// interfaces/http/error-mapper.ts
import { DomainError, UserNotActiveError, UserNotFoundError } from "../../domain/errors";

export function toHttpError(error: unknown): { status: number; body: object } {
  if (error instanceof UserNotFoundError) {
    return { status: 404, body: { message: error.message } };
  }
  if (error instanceof UserNotActiveError) {
    return { status: 409, body: { message: error.message } };
  }
  if (error instanceof DomainError) {
    return { status: 400, body: { message: error.message } };
  }
  return { status: 500, body: { message: "internal server error" } };
}
```

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

- **Domain tests**: pure unit tests, no mocks unless unavoidable
- **Application tests**: orchestration tests using fake repositories / event bus
- **Infrastructure tests**: integration tests against real database or containerized dependencies
- **Interface tests**: request/response tests at HTTP/RPC boundary

Priority order:
1. Domain invariants
2. Command handler orchestration
3. Repository persistence behavior
4. Error mapping and transport behavior

Avoid:
- re-implementing domain logic inside tests
- asserting only TypeScript types without runtime behavior
- mock-heavy tests that never touch the changed boundary

---

## 10. Composition Root

The application is assembled at the edge, not inside Domain.

```ts
// apps/api/src/main.ts
import Fastify from "fastify";

import { KyselyUserRepository } from "./modules/user/infrastructure/persistence/user.repository";
import { ChangePasswordHandler } from "./modules/user/application/handlers/change-password.handler";
import { userRoutes } from "./modules/user/interfaces/http/user.routes";
import { createDb } from "./shared/db/create-db";
import { InMemoryEventBus } from "./shared/event-bus/event-bus";
import { KyselyUnitOfWork } from "./shared/tx/kysely-unit-of-work";

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  const app = Fastify();
  const db = createDb();
  const eventBus = new InMemoryEventBus();
  const uow = new KyselyUnitOfWork(db);
  const userRepository = new KyselyUserRepository(db);
  const changePassword = new ChangePasswordHandler(userRepository, uow, eventBus);

  await app.register(userRoutes(changePassword));
  await app.listen({ port: 8080, host: "0.0.0.0" });
}

void main();
```

Guidelines:
- Wire dependencies in `main.ts` or a bounded-context `module.ts`
- Do not let Domain or Application instantiate concrete infrastructure
- Keep framework bootstrapping and plugin registration at the edge

## 11. Key Principles Summary

> These are the TypeScript-specific phrasings of the principles summarized in [ddd-core.md §11](ddd-core.md). For the architecture review checklist see [ddd-core.md §10](ddd-core.md).

1. **Domain layer has no concrete implementation dependencies** — no `import` of Kysely / Prisma / TypeORM, Fastify / Express / Nest, HTTP/MQ clients, or generated protocol packages; `node:crypto`, `ulid`, and small in-memory helpers are allowed when they don't couple Domain to an external system
2. **Vertical slicing** — organize by bounded context (`modules/<context>/`), not by technical layer
3. **Dependency inversion** — Domain defines write Repository interfaces; Application defines read QueryRepository interfaces; Infrastructure implements both
4. **Port granularity** — define interfaces by caller semantics, not implementation technology; cache/database/queue clients stay inside Infrastructure unless they are a named use-case capability ([ddd-modeling.md §0.2](ddd-modeling.md))
5. **Aggregate boundary** — Repository operates on aggregate roots only, not child entities
6. **State encapsulation** — all state changes go through domain methods; use `private` fields, `readonly`, and `private constructor` + static factories to prevent external mutation
7. **ID generation in Domain** — use `ulid()` / `uuidv7()` factory inside the aggregate's `create()`; database auto-increment IDs are prohibited
8. **Disciplined cross-context communication** — Integration Messages (default for cross-context state propagation), cross-context queries (read-only DTOs through a published facade port — *not* another context's internal `UserQueryRepository`), ACL, or protocol contracts; direct imports of another context's Domain model are prohibited; Integration Message payloads carry the ID plus minimum necessary facts
9. **Event collection** — aggregates collect events in a private array; Application calls `collectEvents()` after successful `save()` to drain and dispatch
10. **CQRS** — Commands go through the Domain model; Queries go through QueryRepository directly to the DB and return DTO `type`s
11. **Transaction boundary** — one Command Handler owns one transaction (typically via `UnitOfWork.runInTransaction`); one transaction modifies one aggregate only
12. **Repository collection semantics** — `save()` is the single method covering create, update, and state-driven soft delete; `version === 0` → INSERT, `version > 0` → version-guarded UPDATE; never split into `insert()` / `update()` / `delete()` by SQL operation
13. **Soft delete** — business-driven deletion is modeled as Domain state; `deleted_at` is always an Infrastructure concern
14. **Optimistic locking** — Infrastructure increments `version` via `SET version = version + 1 WHERE version = ?`; Domain holds `version` as a read-only token; always reload via `repo.get()` after `save()` before further operations
15. **Event dispatch timing** — dispatch after successful persist (after `runInTransaction` resolves), never before
16. **Event reliability** — Domain Event delivery is bounded-context-internal and implementation-specific; cross-context Integration Messages default to adapter delivery semantics plus consumer-side idempotency, with explicit reliability design only when pre-publish loss is unacceptable
17. **Technical capability classification** — technical-facing code (dispatchers, registries, schedulers, routers, projections, ownership managers) is Domain-facing when it owns stable language, states, policies, or invariants; Infrastructure only adapts external systems and mechanisms ([ddd-core.md §3.1](ddd-core.md))
18. **Type safety** — `tsconfig` `strict: true`; never use `any` to escape type errors; prefer branded types or value objects over loose primitives at Domain boundaries
19. **Async discipline** — Repository / QueryRepository / external clients return `Promise`; Domain methods stay synchronous unless the rule itself is asynchronous
